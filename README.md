# Planetas
I did this project thinking in learning all the basis of web development. Was one of my firsts pages I ever made.

Your function is very simple. The user put his weight in an Input and JavaScript transform this in the weight that corresponds to another planet.
I have to learn about Functions, Loops and how to write in the Document with javascript.
